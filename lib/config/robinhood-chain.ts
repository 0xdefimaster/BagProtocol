// VERIFICATION NOTE (do not remove): every value below was cross-checked
// against Robinhood's own documentation (docs.robinhood.com/chain/contracts,
// docs.robinhood.com/chain/protocol-contracts) at the time this file was
// written, plus independent third-party confirmation for the reward-token
// decimals (Robinhood's own docs page does not print decimals; four
// unrelated third-party integration docs — none of which cite each other —
// independently agree on 6). If Robinhood ever changes any of these
// addresses, this is the ONLY file that needs to change; nothing else in
// the codebase should hardcode a chain id, token address, or RPC URL.
//
// VERIFIED (this session): Uniswap's own official deployments page,
// https://developers.uniswap.org/docs/protocols/v3/deployments/v3-robinhood-chain-deployments
// — a first-party Uniswap Labs source, purpose-built for Robinhood Chain,
// explicitly naming chainId 4663, using the same template Uniswap
// publishes for every other chain (Arbitrum, Base, etc.), and internally
// consistent with Robinhood's own Permit2 listing (identical canonical
// address). This resolves the router-address blocker every prior pass
// left open — do not revert to `null` without a real reason.
