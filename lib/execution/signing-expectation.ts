// Item 8. `ExecutionMode`'s own doc states the rule this module enforces:
// "never let the UI say '1 signature' when the compiled result is actually
// MULTI_TX". Before this, `CompiledExecution.mode` was computed and then
// dropped, and `PurchasePreviewModal` told every user the same singular
// sentence ("signs and sends a real transaction") regardless of whether the
// purchase was one Composer transaction or a sequential LI.FI plan needing
// an approval plus a swap per leg.
//
// Deliberately a PURE function over data the intent already carries — no
// React, no fetch, no provider knowledge. The UI renders what this returns;
// it does not do its own arithmetic over steps, so there is exactly one
// place where "how many wallet confirmations is this?" is decided.
//
// The honesty rule, applied in both directions:
//   - Never under-report. A MULTI_TX plan says so, with its real count.
//   - Never over-claim precision. When the mode is unknown (a legacy,
//     flag-off intent that never had a compiler-determined mode), this
//     returns `exact: false` and a range-free description derived from the
//     steps themselves, rather than asserting a number it cannot know.
