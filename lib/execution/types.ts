// ABOVE `PurchaseIntent` (types/purchase-intent.ts, still the persisted,
// LI.FI-shaped business record). Nothing here replaces either of those —
// `lib/execution/plan.ts` builds a `BagExecutionGraph` FROM an
// `ExecutionPlan`, and a later integration pass is what teaches
// `lib/server/purchase-execution.ts` to go through the compiler below
// instead of calling `lifi-purchase-quote.ts` directly (see README.md).
//
// Naming: "Bag" prefix throughout (`BagExecutionIntent`, `BagExecutionLeg`,
// ...) to make clear these are BAG's OWN abstraction, not a LI.FI shape —
// LI.FI is one provider among several behind `BagExecutionProvider`
// (providers/types.ts), never the center of this model.

 *
 * `lib/execution/plan.ts`'s `purchaseIntentToBagExecutionIntent()` is the

 * one for callers that already hold a `PurchaseIntent`.
