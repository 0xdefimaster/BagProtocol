// composer-status.ts — the Composer counterpart to lifi-status.ts.
//
// WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE FILE, NOT A BRANCH INSIDE lifi-status.ts:
// lifi-status.ts's `trackStepStatus()` is built entirely around `@lifi/sdk`'s
// `getStatus()` — LI.FI's OWN cross-chain bridge/swap status tracker, keyed
// by a `tool`/route LI.FI itself quoted. A Composer transaction is not a
// LI.FI-quoted route at all — it's a direct on-chain call to Composer's own
// execution VM (see lifi-composer-adapter.ts) — so `getStatus()` has no way
// to know about it and was never going to be the right tool for this,
// regardless of how this module is organized. This checks the transaction
// receipt directly instead, same-chain and atomic, so there is no
// cross-chain bridge-completion polling to do in the first place — a
// receipt is the final answer the moment it exists.
//
// WHAT "DONE" MEANS HERE: same principle as lifi-status.ts's own doc
// comment — credit what was ACTUALLY received on-chain, never the
// pre-execution simulated estimate. This decodes every ERC-20 `Transfer`
// log in the receipt and sums the amounts sent TO the purchasing wallet,
// per token address — the caller (purchase-execution.ts) matches those
// against each step's expected `outputAsset` itself, the same
// "asset actually received must match what the registry-verified step
// expected, or it's VERIFICATION_FAILED, never silently accepted" rule
// lifi-status.ts already enforces for the sequential path.
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
