// the depositor's own wallet, so there is no vault a fee could be skimmed
// from at settlement time):
//   - High Water Mark      — NOT a separate tracked value. Instead,
//     `bag_investor_positions.cost_basis_quote` is reduced PROPORTIONALLY
//     to shares burned on every redemption (supabase/migrations/
//     0012_add_redeem_execution.sql's apply_redeem_execution()). Profit is
//     computed per-redemption as (that redemption's value minus the cost
//     basis it consumed), so a loss is never taxed and a gain already
//     realized (and fee'd) can never be taxed again when the remaining
//     position merely recovers — the classic HWM failure mode a per-lot,
//     proportional-cost-basis model sidesteps without needing its own
//     column.
//   - Performance Baseline — this depositor's OWN cost basis, never a
//     benchmark and never another depositor's basis.
//   - Fee Crystallization  — at redemption, never continuously. An
//     unrealized (paper) gain is never fee'd; only value the depositor
//     actually redeemed is.
//   - Fee Recipient        — THIS bag's own creator (`bags.creator_id`),
//     not the protocol and not a fork's root creator (see
//     `FORK_ROYALTY_BPS`, lib/config/rewards.ts, for the separate,
//     deposit-time reward a fork's ROOT creator earns instead).
//   - Fee Asset            — quote-currency value, credited to the
//     creator's `portfolios.cash_balance` (the same paper-portfolio ledger
//     `commit_investment_transaction()` already settles trades into) —
//     NOT an on-chain transfer. With no pooled custody, a same-transaction
//     on-chain fee-split would require adding a whole new signed swap leg
//     to every redemption — real, but substantially more engineering than
//     this phase's scope. Recorded as a real, auditable ledger credit
//     (an `activities` row + a real balance update) now; paying it out
//     on-chain is a deliberate follow-up, not pretended to already work.
//   - Fee Accounting       — computed entirely from THIS depositor's own
//     `bag_investor_positions` row at redemption time; never touches
//     `bag_share_state`/NAV-per-share, so no other depositor's holdings or
//     redemption value are ever affected by one depositor's fee.
