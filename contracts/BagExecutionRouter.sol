/// @notice Item 7's production BAG-native execution router. Executes ONE
/// compiled BAG execution plan (`lib/execution/types.ts`'s
/// `CompiledExecution`) as a single atomic transaction: pull the user's
/// input asset, run N allowlisted swap legs, verify every output against
/// its own minimum, return everything to the user.
///
/// This REPLACES `contracts/spike/BagRouterSpike.sol` as the production
/// boundary. That contract remains untouched, for the Phase 19.X
/// composability spike it was written for, and must never be used to move
/// real user funds — it accepts an arbitrary `target` (so its own calldata
/// can be pointed at an ERC-20 to drain another user's leftover allowance),
/// verifies output with an absolute `balanceOf` (so tokens injected into the
/// router by anyone satisfy a `minOutput` the legs never actually produced),
/// and has no notion of which Bag, which plan, or which deadline it is
/// executing for. Every one of those is a deliberate, tested boundary here.
///
/// ------------------------------------------------------------------
/// TRUST BOUNDARY (item 1) — five separate parties, none of which can
/// take another's powers:
///
///  1. `bagFactory` (immutable) — the ONLY trusted Bag registry. A plan is
///     executable only for a `bagId` that `BagFactory.bagOf()` actually
///     resolves to a deployed `Bag`. Reuses the existing factory
///     (item 6); this router never re-implements Bag identity, never
///     deploys a Bag, and never writes to one.
///  2. `owner` — admin/governance (a multisig in production, same
///     expectation as `BagFactory.owner` / `CreatorRewardsVault.owner`).
///     Manages the target/token allowlists and rotates `planSigner`.
///     CANNOT move user funds, cannot execute a plan, cannot sign one.
///  3. `planSigner` — the backend key that attests "this exact plan came
///     out of BAG's own compiler" by EIP-712-signing it. CANNOT move
///     funds, cannot change allowlists, and cannot direct output anywhere
///     (see #4). Compromise of this key alone lets an attacker author
///     plans, but every such plan is still confined to allowlisted
///     targets/tokens and still pays out solely to whoever calls it.
///  4. the CALLER (`msg.sender`) — the user, and the only source and
///     destination of funds. Input is pulled from `msg.sender`; ALL output
///     and ALL leftovers go back to `msg.sender`. There is deliberately no
///     `recipient` parameter anywhere in this contract, so a stolen or
///     malicious plan still cannot redirect a single token to a third
///     party — the worst it can do is waste the caller's own funds within
///     the caller's own declared minimums.
///  5. external protocols (`leg.target`) — untrusted by default, usable
///     only once `owner` allowlists them, never able to receive an
///     allowance beyond the exact amount a leg declares.
